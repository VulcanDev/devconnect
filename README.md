# DevConnect

## The Project

This project is based on a web-course on Udemy, specifically [MERN Stack Front to Back](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/). However, this project is not a one for one copy. I've implemented some of my own coding styles, features and styling for the site. The source code for the project in the course mentioned earlier is available [here](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devconnector).

> This site is a social network app built using the MERN stack that allows developers to create accounts, make public text posts, and create customized profiles including links to their other social media, websites, and information about themselves.

## My Features

- [x] Favicon and Logo art
- [ ] Connect social media accounts: Integrate social media sites API for validating ownership of social media
- [ ] Use a custom Foundation UI for the website instead of the premade bootstrap one

More to come. Features will be developed after completing the base project.

## Live Host

Site will be hosted on Heroku upon completion of the base project.
